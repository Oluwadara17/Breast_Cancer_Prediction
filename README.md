# Title: Breast_Cancer_Prediction
This project is focused on utilising multiple machine learning algorithms to diagnose breast cancer based on various features.

About the Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset, which consists of various features extracted from breast mass samples. The goal is to classify the samples as either malignant (M) or benign (B) based on these features.

Project Tasks
# Data Exploration: Started by exploring the dataset, understanding the features, and identifying any missing or erroneous values.

# Preprocessing and Feature Engineering: Performed necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, scaling features, and encoding the target variable.

# Model Training and Evaluation: Trained different classifiers, such as Random Forests and SVM, on the preprocessed dataset. Evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics and select the best-performing model.

# Model Deployment and Submission: Deploy the selected model on the test dataset and generate predictions. 

# Evaluation
The evaluation metric for this project is "Accuracy".
Accuracy measures the proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total number of instances.

# Result 
The best model for the project is Random Forest, having an accuracy of 95.7% while SVM has 95.2%.
